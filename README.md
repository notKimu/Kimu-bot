## Contributing
If you want to contribute to my development you need to fork and clone me to your PC, then you can test me, add me new things, fix my shitty code and much more!

Here are the steps:

- 
    Fork my repo, for that you can use the fork button here in github

_ _ _
- 
    Clone your fork to your PC using git if you can, is much faster:
    
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/<Username>/Kimu-bot
    ```
    If you really really really don´t want to use git just download the code in a zip:

_ _ _
- Edit your code and push it to your repo:
    
    ```bash
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "What you changed"
    $ git push https://github.com/<Username>/Kimu-bot
    ```
    
    This is how the .env file looks like:
    ```env
    TOKEN="<bot token>"
    clientId="<client ID>"
    MONDONGO="<mongo db url>"
    DBPASS="<password for MySQL database>"
    LEVELS="<level up channel ID>"
    LOGS="<log channel ID>"
    ```
    
    > Remember to add your .env file to .gitignore!!!
